    "AI Agents are intelligent software systems designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals with minimal human intervention. Unlike traditional programs that follow fixed rules, AI agents can learn from data, adapt to changing conditions, and improve their performance over time. They often combine techniques from machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and reinforcement learning to operate effectively in complex environments.\n",
    "AI agents can be reactive, responding instantly to inputs, or proactive, planning future actions based on predicted outcomes. Examples include virtual assistants like chatbots, recommendation systems on streaming platforms, autonomous robots, and self-driving vehicles. In multi-agent systems, several AI agents interact with each other, collaborating or competing to solve large-scale problems such as traffic management, financial trading, or online gaming.\n",
    "One of the key strengths of AI agents is their ability to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, increasing efficiency and reducing human error. In healthcare, AI agents assist in diagnosis and patient monitoring; in education, they personalize learning experiences; and in business, they optimize supply chains and customer support.\n",
    "However, the development of AI agents also raises ethical and social concerns, including data privacy, transparency, and accountability. Ensuring that AI agents are reliable, fair, and aligned with human values is essential.
